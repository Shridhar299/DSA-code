/*  Problem Statement: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. 
A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.

Example 2:
Input:

 arr = [10, 22, 12, 3, 0, 6]
Output:

 22 12 6
Explanation:

 6 is a leader. In addition to that, 12 is greater than all the elements in its right side (3, 0, 6), 
 also 22 is greater than 12, 3, 0, 6.
